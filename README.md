## Overview

**Well is the Chrome extension that becomes every founder’s best friend when accounting season hits.**

It automates supplier invoice collection and pipes the data directly into your accounting tools, ERP, or dashboards — with zero effort.

Built for founders, solo operators, and lean teams, Well replaces hours of repetitive clicking, dragging, chasing, and copy-pasting. What used to eat up days across tax seasons now takes one click — so you can stay focused on building, not chasing PDFs.

At its core, Well is a **Chrome extension** that automates browser workflows on your behalf — boosting productivity when batch-collecting invoices. You can also use it on the go: as you browse, it identifies paid invoices and proactively suggests collection.

**Features include:**
- WhatsApp and email ingestion
- Google Drive and Slack integrations
- AI-generated workflow blueprints
- Self-healing automations that adapt to changes

We believe invoice exchange should follow a universal protocol: instant, standardized, and automated. You shouldn’t have to think about it. With Well, you won’t.
